## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jfitchew/BR-Analysis-010722/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.  

## Plots
- [All Fields](R4/AllFields.html)
- [All Laps-Power](R4/AllLaps-Power.html)
- [All Laps-Speeds](R4/AllLaps-Speeds.html)
- [Power by Sector](R4/PowerBySector.html)
- [Rolling CdA](R4/RollingCdA.html)
- [Speed by Sector](R4/SpeedBySector.html)
- [Wind Direction](R4/WindDirection.html)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Jfitchew/BR-Analysis-010722/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
